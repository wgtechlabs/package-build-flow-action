## Quick Start

### Basic Usage

```yaml
name: Build and Publish

on:
  pull_request:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
      - dev

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20'
      
      - uses: wgtechlabs/package-build-flow-action@v1
        with:
          npm-token: ${{ secrets.NPM_TOKEN }}
          github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          registry: 'both'
          # package-scope not needed - auto-scoped for GitHub Packages! ✨
```

## Flow Detection

The action automatically detects the build flow based on GitHub context:

| Flow Type | Trigger | Version Format | NPM Tag | Description |
|-----------|---------|----------------|---------|-------------|
| **release** | GitHub Release (standard) | `{tag}` (with leading `v` stripped, e.g., `v1.0.0` → `1.0.0`) | `latest` | Production release from GitHub release event |
| **release** | GitHub Release (pre-release) | `{tag}` (with leading `v` stripped) | `{prerelease-id}` (or `prerelease` if no identifier is detected) | Pre-release from GitHub release event (e.g., beta, alpha) |
| **pr** | PR → dev branch | `{base}-pr.{sha}` | `pr` | Pre-release for testing PR changes |
| **dev** | PR dev→main OR push to dev | `{base}-dev.{sha}` | `dev` | Development version for integration testing |
| **patch** | PR → main (not from dev) | `{base}-patch.{sha}` | `patch` | Hotfix pre-release for testing |
| **staging** | Push to main | `{base}-staging.{sha}` | `staging` | Staging version for final validation before release |
| **wip** | Other branches | `{base}-wip.{sha}` | `wip` | Experimental build from feature branch |

### Flow Examples

#### GitHub Release (Production)
```
Event: release
Release Type: Standard Release
Tag: v1.0.0
Version: 1.0.0
NPM Tag: latest
```

#### GitHub Release (Pre-release)
```
Event: release
Release Type: Pre-release
Tag: v1.0.0-beta.1
Version: 1.0.0-beta.1
NPM Tag: beta
```

#### GitHub Release (Pre-release - staging tag)
```
Event: release
Release Type: Pre-release
Tag: v1.2.3-staging.abc1234
Version: 1.2.3-staging.abc1234
NPM Tag: staging
```

> [!WARNING]
> **Avoid using `staging` as a prerelease identifier in GitHub Releases.**
>
> The `staging` npm dist-tag is automatically used by the push-to-main flow (e.g., `1.2.3-staging.abc1234`). If you also create a GitHub Release with a `staging` prerelease identifier (e.g., `v1.2.3-staging.abc1234`), both flows will publish under the same `staging` dist-tag. This means whichever version is published last will overwrite the `staging` tag pointer, and running `npm install mypackage@staging` will resolve to that last-published version instead of the one you might expect.
>
> This won't break anything — both versions remain available by their exact version number (e.g., `npm install mypackage@1.2.3-staging.abc1234`). It only affects which version the `staging` dist-tag shortcut points to. If you want to avoid this overlap, use a different prerelease identifier for your GitHub Releases that doesn't collide with any of the built-in flow tags (`pr`, `dev`, `patch`, `staging`, `wip`).

    "version": "2.0.0-dev.abc1234",
    "result": "failed",
    "error": "Build failed"
  }
]
```

## Configuration Guide

### Package Manager Selection

The action supports multiple package managers with automatic detection:

#### Auto-Detection (Default)

When `package-manager: 'auto'` (default), the action automatically selects the package manager based on lockfile presence:

1. If `bun.lockb` exists → Uses **Bun**
2. If `pnpm-lock.yaml` exists → Uses **pnpm**
3. If `yarn.lock` exists → Uses **Yarn**
4. If `package-lock.json` exists → Uses **npm**
5. Neither → Falls back to **npm**

This ensures lockfile consistency and preserves backward compatibility.

#### Manual Selection

Explicitly specify the package manager:

```yaml
- uses: wgtechlabs/package-build-flow-action@v1
  with:
    package-manager: 'pnpm'  # or 'npm', 'yarn', 'bun'
    npm-token: ${{ secrets.NPM_TOKEN }}
```

#### Package Manager Examples

##### Bun

For Bun-based projects, install both Node.js (for publishing) and Bun (for building):

```yaml
steps:
  - uses: actions/checkout@v4

  - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
    with:
      node-version: '20'

  - uses: oven-sh/setup-bun@v2
    with:
      bun-version: latest

  - uses: wgtechlabs/package-build-flow-action@v1
    with:
      package-manager: 'bun'  # or 'auto' to detect from bun.lockb
      npm-token: ${{ secrets.NPM_TOKEN }}
      github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

##### pnpm

For pnpm-based projects:

```yaml
steps:
  - uses: actions/checkout@v4

  - uses: pnpm/action-setup@v2
    with:
      version: 8

  - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
    with:
      node-version: '20'
      cache: 'pnpm'

  - uses: wgtechlabs/package-build-flow-action@v1
    with:
      package-manager: 'pnpm'  # or 'auto' to detect from pnpm-lock.yaml
      npm-token: ${{ secrets.NPM_TOKEN }}
      github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

##### Yarn

For Yarn-based projects:

```yaml
steps:
  - uses: actions/checkout@v4

  - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
    with:
      node-version: '20'
      cache: 'yarn'

  - uses: wgtechlabs/package-build-flow-action@v1
    with:
      package-manager: 'yarn'  # or 'auto' to detect from yarn.lock
      npm-token: ${{ secrets.NPM_TOKEN }}
      github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

**Note:** This action always uses the npm CLI for the final publish step, regardless of the selected package manager. While Bun, pnpm, and Yarn can publish to the npm registry, this action standardizes on npm for publishing to ensure consistent behavior across environments.

### NPM Registry Setup

1. Create an NPM access token at https://www.npmjs.com/settings/tokens
2. Add the token as a repository secret: `NPM_TOKEN`
3. Configure the action:

```yaml
- uses: wgtechlabs/package-build-flow-action@v1
  with:
    registry: 'npm'
    npm-token: ${{ secrets.NPM_TOKEN }}
```

#### Scoped Package Access

When publishing scoped packages (e.g., `@org/package-name`) to NPM, the action defaults to `--access public` to avoid 402 payment errors. Scoped packages are private by default on npm, but most open-source packages should be public.

**Default Behavior (Public Access):**

```yaml
- uses: wgtechlabs/package-build-flow-action@v1
  with:
    registry: 'npm'
    npm-token: ${{ secrets.NPM_TOKEN }}
    # access: 'public' is the default - scoped packages will be public
```

**Private Package Publishing (Requires Paid NPM Plan):**

If you have a paid NPM plan and want to publish private scoped packages:

```yaml
- uses: wgtechlabs/package-build-flow-action@v1
  with:
    registry: 'npm'
    npm-token: ${{ secrets.NPM_TOKEN }}
    access: 'restricted'  # Publishes as private package
```

**Alternative: Use publishConfig in package.json**

You can also set the access level in your `package.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "@myorg/my-package",
  "publishConfig": {
    "access": "public"
  }
}
```

The action's `access` input will override `publishConfig` if both are specified.

### GitHub Packages Setup

GitHub Packages requires all packages to be scoped (e.g., `@owner/package-name`). The action provides **automatic scope detection** to make this seamless:

#### 🎯 Automatic Scope Detection

The action automatically scopes your package using this priority order:

1. **Explicit scope from `package-scope` input** → Uses provided scope
2. **Existing scope in package.json** → Uses scope from package name
3. **Repository owner** → **Automatically uses `@{repository-owner}`** ✨

This means **most users don't need to configure anything** - the action will automatically scope packages using your repository owner!

#### Scoping Outcomes

| Your package.json | package-scope Input | GitHub Packages Publishes As |
|-------------------|---------------------|------------------------------|
| `"name": "mypackage"` | _(empty)_ | `@owner/mypackage` ✨ Auto-scoped! |
| `"name": "mypackage"` | `@custom` | `@custom/mypackage` |
| `"name": "@org/mypackage"` | _(any)_ | `@org/mypackage` |

#### Basic Setup (Zero Configuration)

For most cases, you don't need to provide `package-scope`:

```yaml
- uses: wgtechlabs/package-build-flow-action@v1
  with:
    registry: 'github'
    github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    # package-scope not needed - auto-scoped as @{owner}!
```

#### Custom Scope (Optional)

If you want to use a different scope than the repository owner:

```yaml
- uses: wgtechlabs/package-build-flow-action@v1
  with:
    registry: 'github'
    github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    package-scope: '@myorg'
```

### Dual Registry Publishing

Publish to both NPM and GitHub Packages. GitHub Packages will use auto-scoping if needed:

```yaml
- uses: wgtechlabs/package-build-flow-action@v1
  with:
    registry: 'both'
    npm-token: ${{ secrets.NPM_TOKEN }}
    github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    # package-scope optional - auto-scoped for GitHub Packages
```

Or with custom scope:

```yaml
- uses: wgtechlabs/package-build-flow-action@v1
  with:
    registry: 'both'
    npm-token: ${{ secrets.NPM_TOKEN }}
    github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    package-scope: '@myorg'  # Use custom scope
```

## Versioning Strategy

### SemVer Compliance

All versions follow Semantic Versioning (SemVer) format: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH[-prerelease]`

- **Base Version**: Read from package.json
- **Pre-release Suffix**: Automatically added based on flow type
- **Dist-tags**: Used to hide pre-releases from `npm install` defaults

### Dist-tag Strategy

Pre-release versions use non-latest dist-tags to prevent accidental installation:

```bash
# Latest production version (no tag needed)
npm install mypackage

# Pre-release versions require explicit tag or version
npm install mypackage@dev
npm install mypackage@1.2.3-dev.abc1234

# Production releases use 'latest' tag (default)
npm install mypackage@latest
```

### Version Increment Rules

- **PR to dev**: Uses base version with `-pr.{sha}` suffix
- **Dev branch**: Uses base version with `-dev.{sha}` suffix
- **Patch PR**: Uses base version with `-patch.{sha}` suffix
- **Staging (main)**: Uses base version with `-staging.{sha}` suffix

## Security Scanning

The action includes built-in npm audit integration:

```yaml
- uses: wgtechlabs/package-build-flow-action@v1
  with:
    audit-enabled: 'true'
    audit-level: 'high'
    fail-on-audit: 'true'
```

Audit results are:
- Displayed in action logs
- Included in PR comments
- Available as action outputs
- Optionally fail the build

## PR Comments

Automatic PR comments include:

- 📦 Package information (name, version, dist-tag)
- 📥 Installation instructions for each registry
- 🏷️ Dist-tag shortcuts
- 🔒 Security audit results (if enabled)
- 🔗 Links to registry pages

### Custom Comment Template

Create a custom PR comment format:

```yaml
- uses: wgtechlabs/package-build-flow-action@v1
  with:
    pr-comment-template: |
      ## Build Complete
      
      Version: {PACKAGE_VERSION}
      Flow: {BUILD_FLOW}
      
      Install: {NPM_INSTALL}
      
      {AUDIT_RESULTS}
```

Template variables:
- `{BUILD_FLOW}`: Flow type
- `{PACKAGE_VERSION}`: Generated version
- `{NPM_INSTALL}`: NPM install command
- `{GITHUB_INSTALL}`: GitHub Packages install command
- `{AUDIT_RESULTS}`: Security audit summary

## Advanced Examples

### Full-Featured Workflow

```yaml
name: Advanced Build and Publish

on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [main, dev]
  push:
    branches: [main, dev]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: read
      packages: write
      pull-requests: write
    
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20'
      
      - uses: wgtechlabs/package-build-flow-action@v1
        id: build
        with:
          # Registries
          registry: 'both'
          npm-token: ${{ secrets.NPM_TOKEN }}
          github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          package-scope: '@myorg'
          
          # Branches
          main-branch: 'main'
          dev-branch: 'develop'
          
          # Package
          package-path: './package.json'
          build-script: 'build'
          
          # Security
          audit-enabled: 'true'
          audit-level: 'high'
          fail-on-audit: 'false'
          
          # PR Comments
          pr-comment-enabled: 'true'
      
      - name: Display Results
        run: |
          echo "Version: ${{ steps.build.outputs.package-version }}"
          echo "Flow Type: ${{ steps.build.outputs.build-flow-type }}"
          echo "NPM Published: ${{ steps.build.outputs.npm-published }}"
          echo "GitHub Published: ${{ steps.build.outputs.github-published }}"
```

### Production Release Workflow

The action automatically detects GitHub release events and publishes packages with the correct version from the release tag. No manual version updates needed!

```yaml
name: Production Release

on:
  release:
    types: [published]

jobs:
  release:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: read
      packages: write
    
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20'
      
      # No manual version update needed - automatically uses release tag!
      - uses: wgtechlabs/package-build-flow-action@v1
        with:
          registry: 'both'
          npm-token: ${{ secrets.NPM_TOKEN }}
          github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          package-scope: '@myorg'
          audit-enabled: 'true'
          fail-on-audit: 'true'
```

**How it works:**
- **Standard Release (v1.0.0)**: Publishes `1.0.0` with `latest` npm tag
- **Pre-release (v1.0.0-beta.1)**: Publishes `1.0.0-beta.1` with `beta` npm tag
- **Staging Release (v1.2.3-staging.abc1234)**: Publishes `1.2.3-staging.abc1234` with `staging` npm tag

### Dry Run Mode

Test the action without publishing:

```yaml
- uses: wgtechlabs/package-build-flow-action@v1
  with:
    dry-run: 'true'
    npm-token: ${{ secrets.NPM_TOKEN }}
```

### Monorepo Support

Process multiple packages in a monorepo with independent versioning.

#### Automatic Workspace Discovery

The action can automatically discover packages from your workspace configuration:

```yaml
name: Monorepo Build and Publish

on:
  push:
    branches: [main, dev]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main, dev]

jobs:
  build-monorepo:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: read
      packages: write
    
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20'
      
      - name: Build and Publish Multiple Packages
        id: build
        uses: wgtechlabs/package-build-flow-action@v2
        with:
          # Enable monorepo mode
          monorepo: 'true'
          
          # Auto-discover packages from workspaces (default: true)
          # No package-paths needed!
          
          # Registry configuration
          registry: 'both'
          npm-token: ${{ secrets.NPM_TOKEN }}
          github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
      
      - name: Display Discovered Packages
        run: |
          echo "Discovered ${{ steps.build.outputs.package-count }} packages:"
          echo '${{ steps.build.outputs.discovered-packages }}' | jq '.'
      
      - name: Display Build Results
        run: |
          echo "Build Results:"
          echo '${{ steps.build.outputs.build-results }}' | jq '.'
```

**Root package.json with workspaces:**
```json
{
  "name": "my-monorepo",
  "private": true,
  "workspaces": [
    "core",
    "apps/*",
    "plugins/*"
  ]
}
```

The action will:
- Read the `workspaces` field from root `package.json`
- Resolve glob patterns like `apps/*` and `plugins/*`
- Skip packages with `"private": true`
- Process all discovered publishable packages

#### Manual Package List

You can also explicitly specify packages (takes priority over workspace detection):

```yaml
name: Monorepo Build and Publish

on:
  push:
    branches: [main, dev]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main, dev]

jobs:
  build-monorepo:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: read

```

**Key Features:**
- Each package gets its own version based on its `package.json`
- Packages are processed sequentially
- If one package fails, remaining packages still attempt to build/publish
- Returns JSON array with per-package results
- Works with `dry-run` and `publish-enabled: false`
- Supports both workspace auto-discovery and explicit package lists

**Example Output:**
```json
[
  {
    "name": "@tinyclaw/core",
    "version": "1.0.0-dev.abc1234",
    "result": "success"
  },
  {
    "name": "@tinyclaw/plugin-discord",
    "version": "1.2.0-dev.abc1234",
    "result": "success"
  }
]
```

**Discovered Packages Output:**
```json
[
  {
    "name": "@tinyclaw/core",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "path": "core/package.json",
    "dir": "core"
  },
  {
    "name": "@tinyclaw/plugin-discord",
    "version": "1.2.0",
    "path": "plugins/plugin-discord/package.json",
    "dir": "plugins/plugin-discord"
  }
]
```

## Troubleshooting

### Package Not Published

**Issue**: Package doesn't appear on the registry

**Solutions**:
- Check `npm-token` is valid and has publish permissions
- Verify package name is not already taken
- For GitHub Packages, ensure package name is scoped
- Check action logs for error messages

### Authentication Failed

**Issue**: 401 Unauthorized errors

**Solutions**:
- Verify tokens are correctly set in repository secrets
- For GitHub Packages, ensure `packages: write` permission
- Check token hasn't expired
- For NPM, ensure token type is "Automation" or "Publish"

### Version Already Exists

**Issue**: Cannot publish version that already exists

**Solutions**:
- The action generates unique versions with commit SHA
- If still failing, check if version was manually published
- Verify flow detection is working correctly

### GitHub Packages Scope Issues

**Issue**: Package name must be scoped

**Solutions**:
- Set `package-scope` input: `@myorg`
- Or update package.json name to include scope: `@myorg/package-name`
- Ensure scope matches your GitHub organization

### Security Audit Failures

**Issue**: Build fails due to vulnerabilities

**Solutions**:
- Set `fail-on-audit: 'false'` to continue despite vulnerabilities
- Update dependencies to fix vulnerabilities
- Adjust `audit-level` to be less strict
- Review audit output in action logs

### PR Comments Not Appearing

**Issue**: No comments on pull requests

**Solutions**:
- Ensure `pull-requests: write` permission is granted
- Check `pr-comment-enabled` is set to `'true'`
- Verify `github-token` has correct permissions
- Only works on pull_request events
